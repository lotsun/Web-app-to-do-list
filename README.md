# Web-app-to-do-list

This responsive web app would allow users to create, edit, display, and delete tasks on a to-do list. The app would be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user interface would be designed to be responsive, meaning it would be optimized for use on any device, such as a laptop, tablet, or smartphone. The user would be able to create tasks, edit existing tasks, view all tasks, and delete tasks. The app would also provide the user with the ability to sort tasks by priority, due date, or other criteria. The app would also provide the user with the ability to set reminders for tasks, and to receive notifications when tasks are due.
